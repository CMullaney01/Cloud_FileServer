# Cloud_FileServer
Extending the File Server project written in Go to make more use of the cloud. Please read the roadmap below, for each MileStone there should be a relevant folder in research which explains the decisions.


# Project Roadmap

## ðŸš€ In Progress: Milestone 1: Authentication and Login
- Implement user authentication using a secure method like OAuth or JWT.
- Set up a user database to store user credentials securely.
- Develop a login page and authentication API endpoints.

## File Upload and Storage:
- Allow users to upload files to the server.
- Integrate cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage for storing uploaded files securely.

## File Management:
- Develop APIs for file management operations such as create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on files.
- Implement file organization features like folders or directories.

## Access Control:
- Define access control policies to restrict or grant access to files based on user roles or permissions.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions effectively.

## File Sharing:
- Enable users to share files or folders with other users.
- Implement secure sharing mechanisms with options for setting permissions and expiration dates.

## Versioning and Revision History:
- Implement version control for files to keep track of changes over time.
- Allow users to revert to previous versions if needed.

## Search and Metadata:
- Develop search functionality to allow users to search for files based on metadata or content.
- Implement metadata management for files, such as tags or descriptions.

## Video Streaming:
- Integrate video streaming capabilities to allow users to stream video files stored on the server.
- Implement adaptive bitrate streaming for better performance across different network conditions.

## Content Delivery Network (CDN):
- Utilize a CDN to cache and deliver static assets like videos, improving performance and scalability.

## Transcoding and Encoding:
- Implement video transcoding and encoding services to support multiple formats and resolutions for streaming.

## Analytics and Monitoring:
- Set up monitoring and analytics tools to track server performance, user activity, and usage patterns.
- Implement logging to capture and analyze events for troubleshooting and optimization.

## Security Enhancements:
- Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit to ensure data security.
- Set up intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and mitigate security threats.

## High Availability and Scalability:
- Design the architecture for high availability with redundancy and failover mechanisms.
- Implement auto-scaling to handle varying loads and traffic spikes efficiently.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery:
- Set up regular backups of data stored on the server.
- Develop a disaster recovery plan and implement mechanisms for data restoration in case of failures.

## Compliance and Regulation:
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.
- Implement features for data retention policies and compliance reporting.
